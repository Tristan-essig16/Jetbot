This project revolves around controlling the Jebot using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano both my remote and completely autonmously. For the project the Jupyter notebook was used to program the Jetbot using teleoperation, road following, and object avoidance. Teleoperation was revolved around controlling the jetbot using a remote control, in which we used a logitech game remote. Road following consisted of taking around 300 pictures of the road from different perspectives until the whole track was mapped. The same was done with object avoidance, which consisted of around 150 "free" and "blocked" pictures that marked the objects on the track from a reason distance.
